# Custom Datasets

## Best for Linear Regression

Create your own dataset generating code (call it best4linreg.py) that creates data that performs significantly better with LinRegLearner than KNNLearner.


### Data Generating Algorithm

Explain your data generating algorithm, and explain why LinRegLearner performs better.
Your data should include at least 2 dimensions in X, and at least 1000 points. (Don't use bagging for this section).


## Best for KNN

Create your own dataset generating code (call it best4KNN.py) that creates data that performs significantly better with KNNLearner than LinRegLearner.

### Data Generating Algorithm

Explain your data generating algorithm, and explain why KNNLearner performs better.
Your data should include at least 2 dimensions in X, and at least 1000 points. (Don't use bagging for this section).

# KNN Evaluation

## Effect of K on Overfitting

Consider the dataset ripple with KNN. For which values of K does overfitting occur? (Don't use bagging).


## Effect of Bag Count on Performance

Now use bagging in conjunction with KNN with the ripple dataset.

How does performance vary as you increase the number of bags?


## Effect of Bag Count on Overfitting

Does overfitting occur with respect to the number of bags?


## Effect of Bagging with respect to K

Can bagging reduce or eliminate overfitting with respect to K for the ripple dataset?
