Training Y/Price/Predicted Y: Create a plot that illustrates your training Y values in one color, price in another color and PREDICTED Y in a third color. With this chart we should be able to see how well your learner performs and that your Y values are shifted back 5 days. You may find it convenient to zoom in on a particular time period so this is evident.

Sine Data In Sample Entries/Exits: Create a plot that illustrates entry and exits as vertical lines on a price chart for the in sample period 2008-2009. Show long entries as green lines, short entries as red lines and exits as black lines. You may find it convenient to zoom in on a particular time period so this is evident.

Sine Data Out of Sample Entries/Exits: Freeze your model based on the 2008-2009 data. Now test it for the year 2010 -- Plot that illustrates entry & exits, generate trades,
